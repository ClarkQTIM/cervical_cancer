CSVS:
So, full_dataset_duke_liger_split_df.csv and model_36_split_df_all_gt.csv are the same, but model_36_split_df_all_gt has both testing labels (test, test2).
SRA_cambodia and SRA_dr are the Cambodia and Dominican Republic dataset with bounding boxes and everything.
model_36_split_df_all_gt_test_2.csv is the same as model_36_split_df_all_gt.csv but with only "test_2" testing data renamed to test. As in,
we took model_36_split_df_all_gt.csv and removed any "test" rows and renamed "test_2" to "test" for use in inference. This is done in /mnt/src/csv_creation.py

10/26:
The folder partial_trainings has the csvs used for partial training.

Data Directories:
full_dataset_duke_liger_itoju_5StLowQual has *all* the images the original model was trained on.
SRA_IRIS_Cambodia and SRA_IRIS_DR are the Cambodia and Dominican Republic images respectively.

10/26: 
We moved J8 directly INTO full_dataset_duke_liger_itoju_5StLowQual for a round of trainings.
